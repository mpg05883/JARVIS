We use smartphones, laptops, tablets, and other electronic devices daily. These devices have made communication, entertainment, and work more accessible and convenient than ever before. However, the overuse of such devices has led to several negative consequences. One of the most significant impacts is on our physical health. Prolonged use of electronic devices can cause eye strain, neck and back pain, and poor posture. Additionally, screen time has been linked to sleep disturbances and a decrease in physical activity. Mental health is also affected as excessive screen time has been associated with feelings of loneliness, depression, and anxiety. This is particularly concerning among young people, who spend a significant portion of their day using electronic devices. Furthermore, the constant need to stay connected and updated online has led to a decline in offline social interactions. As a result, there is a growing concern about the impact of technology on interpersonal relationships and overall well-being. To mitigate the negative effects of technology, it is vital to develop healthy habits and use these devices in moderation. Utilizing technological tools mindfully can help us maintain a balance between the benefits and drawbacks of using electronic devices.'",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0,0,0,1.0,1.0,1.0
